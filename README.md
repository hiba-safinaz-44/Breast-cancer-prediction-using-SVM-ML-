# Breast-cancer-prediction-using-SVM-ML-Model
A machine learning project to predict breast cancer (benign or malignant) using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model is trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset with 30 features. Includes preprocessing, EDA, evaluation, and visualizations like heatmap, boxplot, and pie chart. Achieved ~95.6% accuracy.
